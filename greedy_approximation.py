# Greedy Algorithm for Set Cover Problem (Approximation)

# The goal is to find the minimum number of stations that cover all the required states.

# STEP 1: Define the set of states that need coverage.
states_needed = set(["mt", "wa", "or", "id", "nv", "ut", "ca", "az"])

# STEP 2: Define the stations and the states they cover.
stations = {
    "kone": set(["id", "nv", "ut"]),
    "ktwo": set(["wa", "id", "mt"]),
    "kthree": set(["or", "nv", "ca"]),
    "kfour": set(["nv", "ut"]),
    "kfive": set(["ca", "az"]),
}

# STEP 3: Create a set to keep track of the final stations selected.
final_stations = set()


# Greedy approach to find the best stations to cover all states.
while states_needed:
    best_station = None
    states_covered = set()  # States covered by the current best station.

    # Iterate over each station to find the one that covers the most uncovered states.
    for station, states in stations.items():
        # Find the intersection of states covered by this station and the remaining states needed.
        covered = states_needed & states

        # If this station covers more states than the current best station, update it.
        if len(covered) > len(states_covered):
            states_covered = covered
            best_station = station

    # STEP 4: Update the states needed by removing the states covered by the best station.
    states_needed -= states_covered

    # STEP 5: Add the best station to the final set of stations.
    final_stations.add(best_station)


# STEP 6: Print the final set of stations chosen to cover all states.
print("Stations selected:", final_stations)
